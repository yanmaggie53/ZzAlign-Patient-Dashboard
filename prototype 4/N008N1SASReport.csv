"Position changes when at least 5 seconds of continuous position is found. The minimum upright position is at 53.13°"

"Movement is detected when the activity signal exceeds a threshold of 0.2 for a minimum of 1 second(s)."
"Apneas are scored where there is a 90% drop in the Flow signal between 10 and 120 seconds."
"Hypopneas are scored where there is a 30% drop in the Flow signal between 10 and 120 seconds followed by either a drop"
"in saturation of at least 3%, or an arousal."
"A tachycardia is added when the heart rate exceeds 90bpm for at least 30 seconds. Bradycardia is scored when the heart"
"rate falls below 40bpm for at least 30 seconds."
"Limb movements are detected when EMG amplitude is above 5 times background activity for at least 0.5 seconds, but no"
"more than 10 seconds."
"PLMs are detected when at least 4 limb movements occur within a minimum interval of 5 seconds and a maximum interval"
"90 seconds."
"An ECG artifact filter is applied to the leg EMG signals."
"LMs from all channels are combined into one PLM score."
"LMs are not scored if they start 0.5 seconds before an apnea, hypopnea or a RERA, or 0.5 seconds following the event."
"LMs are not scored if they start during movement."
"LMs are not scored if they start during periods of wake."
"Desaturations are marked when the SpO2 values drop by at least 3% for a minimum duration of 3 seconds with a plateau"
"of no more than 45 seconds."
